## Wikiotics is a site for learning a foreign language.

There are instruction materials here for many languages.  Below is a curated list of content, while the [complete lesson repository](http://wikiotics.org/special/list_target_languages) is hosted at wikiotics.org.

### French

- [French phrasebook problems](https://wikiotics.org/fr/French_phrasebook_problems)

### Spanish

- [Flowers](https://wikiotics.org/en/Spanish_lesson_-_Flowers)

## Everything is editable.

These lessons are currently editable through a graphical interface at wikiotics.org, but soon they will transition to being editable [on github](https://github.com/wikiotics/wikiotics.org).
