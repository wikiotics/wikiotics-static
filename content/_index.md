## Wikiotics is a site for learning a foreign language.

Wikiotics hosts freely licensed, user-contributed lessons for the language acquisition community.  There are instruction materials for many languages, listed below.

## Everything is editable.

Each lesson and page on this site is editable [on GitHub](https://github.com/wikiotics/wikiotics.org).  Prior to July 2020, all lessons were built using a graphical interface here on wikiotics.org.  This is where the name "wiki" comes from.
