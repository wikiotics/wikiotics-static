After a year of careful planning, and a fair bit of last minute scrambling around, Wikiotics is now a recognized charity in the United States. This is generally the point where new charaties shift into fundraising mode and ask for your support in the form of a check. I’m not going to do that. If you are interested in Wikiotics, if you care about language instruction or believe in the power of the open web as a teaching tool, please take a moment now and support our charity, not by writing a check, but by joining our community.

There are many ways for you to help that cost no money but are vital to the project’s success. All of them center around you. It doesn’t matter where you are from or how much you know about computers, it doesn’t even matter if you know a second language, you have something to contribute.

You can help by taking pictures and adding them to our [flickr pool](https://www.flickr.com/groups/wikiotics/). You could turn some simple sentences into a lesson, or edit an existing one. If you have an artistic flair, you can help by re-designing our website or making an icon/emblem for the project. You can even help just by talking. Leave some encouraging words in the comments here, tell someone about the project, or drop us a note when you see something interesting about language instruction or open web technologies.

It all helps so please, the next time you are writing a check for some other charity, remember our community and all the other ways to give. Your help is exactly what we need.
