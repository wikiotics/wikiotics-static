The collaboration with RIT's FOSS@RIT campaign I blogged about [last week](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325183259/http://blog.wikiotics.net/2010/10/students-of-free-software/) is now the subject of a press relase from the school [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325183259/http://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=47876).

Currently we're at the top of the University homepage!

Welcome to all the RIT students who have found Wikiotics through that release.
