[Last week](/blog/2010/10/wikiotics-week-2-talking-about-the-weather/) we explored how to use collaboration inside the Wikiotics community to build better lessons for each other and we saw how this can produce [great results](/blog/2010/10/pictures-keep-you-honest) for material like weather vocabulary. But what about the parts of language that are more complicated? What about concepts like “beautiful”, “fun”, “boring”, and “interesting”? We each have different ideas about what these concepts look like and we are unlikely to be able to come to a consensus opinion.

This week we are shifting the focus from consensus to individuality and asking everyone to build personal lessons based on some [shared vocabulary](/blog/2010/10/pictures-keep-you-honest). We want to see your take on some common concepts, your viewpoint. Don’t worry about making lessons for someone else, build a lesson as practice material for your self and at the end of the week we will take a look at the different versions people have built for themselves and see how useful moving away from consensus can be.

How To Participate:
1. Log in.
2. Go to the lesson: [https://wikiotics.org/en/Adjectives](/en/Adjectives) and click on "Copy" at the top.
3. Enter "user:YourUserName/Adjectives" into the copy box and hit enter
4. Click on "Edit" at the top and change the images using the "find new image" link next to each page. That will let you search on flickr for a better picture. If you are getting too many results, try clicking the "Restrict to project's Flickr group" box when you are searching.
5. Save your new lesson and add a link on the [Adjectives talk](/en/Adjectives_talk) page.

As always, thanks for being part of the community!
