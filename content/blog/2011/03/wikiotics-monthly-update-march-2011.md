## SCALE 9x

Ian and I hosted a booth at SCALE 9x in Los Angeles on February 26 and 27. We had live demos of picture-choice lessons (with audio!), and we showed people how to edit lessons. Many people stopped by, and many people were excited about the project.

## DML2011

Ian attended the Digital Media and Learning Conference in Long Beach, California, March 3-5. Among other things, Wikiotics was a last-minute entry into the “Drumbeat science fair.” I am told that Ian met many additional people who are excited about the project.

## Adelphi University

Shortly after the last monthly update, Matthew Curinga posted a message to the list about the research study he is leading at Adelphi University regarding Wikiotics:
