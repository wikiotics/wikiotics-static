[This past Saturday](/blog/2012/09/workshop-and-dimsum/) was the first Wikiotics workshop, an event we have been discussing for many weeks. We had some great participants representing a whole range of New York’s educational organizations, from universities like [Adelphi](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326005005/http://adelphi.edu/) and [Columbia](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326005005/http://www.columbia.edu/), to the [Metropolitan College of New York](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326005005/http://www.mcny.edu/) (MCNY), and the informal MeetUp.com group [Friends of the United Nations English club](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326005005/http://www.meetup.com/esl-426/) group organized to support the UN language school.

During a few short hours we designed and created 4 new lessons, brainstormed topics for 11 more, and, while we were at it, recorded audio for all of our Spanish lessons. You can see the results of our work on the [workshop’s wiki page](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326005005/https://wikiotics.org/en/2012-10-13-ESL_Workshop).

There was so much enthusiasm during the workshop that we have decided to expand it into a series.

I am excited to announce that we already have the next workshop lined up for later this month. Our next workshop will be in New Deli, India where I will be working with teachers from the [Yuva Jyoti](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326005005/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-09-30/news/30228871_1_nsdc-niit-limited-vijay-k-thadani) educaiton centers and the [Hole in the wall computer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326005005/http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/) project.
