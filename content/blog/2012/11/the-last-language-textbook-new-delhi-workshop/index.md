On October 25th and 26th I was in New Delhi running the second workshop in our Last Language Textbook workshop series. A dozen teachers from all over India and I spent two days exploring the capabilities of the Wikiotics tools and building lessons for their students.

You can see all the lessons we built on the [Indian workshop](/en/2012-10-24-IndiaWorkshop) page, including our [second Panjabi lesson](/pa/jasleen) and this great podcast lesson on [asking permission](/en/permission), which was written from scratch by two teachers who were completely new to Wikiotics. It was a great two days and I am excited to continue working with the whole group as they build Wikiotics into their classes going forward.

I want to thank NIIT’s [Yuva Jyoti](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325192026/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-09-30/news/30228871_1_nsdc-niit-limited-vijay-k-thadani) centers for hosting the workshop and our sponsors [Gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net/) and the [Linux Fund](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325192026/http://linuxfund.org/), whose continued support makes this LLT campaign possible. I am particularly grateful to have met all the Yuva Jyoti teachers, who came from half a continent away for the workshop. It was great to meet everyone and I learned a lot about the different challenges and opportunities of teaching in many of India’s regions.

We are looking to run the third LLT workshop over winter break or early in the spring semester. If you are interested in participating in this next workshop, or your school or organization might be interested in hosting that workshop, please send me a note at: contact@wikiotics.org.
