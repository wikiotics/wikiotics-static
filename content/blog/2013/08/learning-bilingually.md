This September the [Last Language Textbook](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325183739/http://thelastlanguagetextbook.org/) is coming to the [Teunis Bergen PS 9 School](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325183739/http://www.ps9brooklyn.org/) in Brooklyn. Our Wikiotics Fellows have [spent the summer building](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325183739/http://blog.wikiotics.net/2013/06/building-for-the-world/) resources to help parents of the school’s bilingual education students learn along with their children. On September 8th we will be introducing these new materials to the community and showing how parents can get involved by building materials for each other, their children, and by participating in school sponsored language exchanges.

Whether you are a parent, teacher, or just a community member interested in English and Spanish education, everyone is welcome at this free event. Join us September 8th from 1:00-4:00pm in the Info Commons room of the [Brooklyn Public Library’s](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325183739/http://iii.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/record=g1008631) historic main branch location at Grand Army Plaza.
