Last night we began the second stage of the [Last Language Textbook](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326005010/http://thelastlanguagetextbook.org/) campaign at Brooklynâ€™s [PS 9](https://www.ps9brooklyn.org/) elementary school. Fifteen parents and teachers gathered together to start a new language exchange organized around the materials that [Wikiotics Fellows](/blog/2013/06/building-for-the-world/) Claribel Sanchez and Jarrett Carter spent the summer building.

I am happy to report that everything went very well and the group is scheduled to meet again on December 2nd to continue learning basic Spanish vocabulary and practice their first English/Spanish dialogues. Any Spanish or English speaking parents in the community who would like to participate, please email us. After December 2nd there will be a more formal schedule for the spring term meetings and we will post about it here.
