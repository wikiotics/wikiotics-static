The collaboration with RIT's FOSS@RIT campaign I blogged about [last week](/blog/2010/10/students-of-free-software/) is now the subject of a press relase from the school [here](https://www.rit.edu/news/rit-initiative-strives-create-free-and-open-source-software).

Currently we're at the top of the University homepage!

Welcome to all the RIT students who have found Wikiotics through that release.
