Back in December, Jim, Laurent, and I spent a week in New York examining every part of Wikiotics, what those parts look like and how they fit together. We have been working behind the scenes all this year to implement the design from that week and I am proud to say that the most public element of it is now visible; Wikiotics.org has a [new face](/ "Wkiotics Front Page"). We hope you will agree that this rebuilt page is both more functional and more attractive than the last version. We had some help with that from Pei-Jun Tan, a great web designer whose contributions have helped give us some more style.

While we have been busy putting together the new site, the good folks at [Linux Format](https://linuxformat.com/ "Linux Format") magazine have been putting together a feature spread on Wikioics for their May issue. This is our first magazine article and I think it looks great. All of you in the UK and other areas where Linux Format is sold can decide for yourself, and catch up on all of their other great free software coverage. Donâ€™t feel shy about letting us know what you think, of the article or anything else in the project, using our new email: contact /at/ wikiotics.org
