This past weekend was the inaugural [WikiConference USA](https://wikiconference.org/), a New York area conference focused on all things wiki. I [presented a summary](https://wikiconference.org/wiki/Submissions:2014/Using_Wikibooks_and_Wikiotics_to_build_community-centered_language_courses "Wikiotics session materials") of our work with PS 9 at a session on Saturday morning and was privileged to share a track with [Gabriel Thullen](https://wikiconferenceusa.org/wiki/Submissions:7th_Grade_wikipedia_project), a Swiss computer and media teacher who helps students contribute to Wikipedia as early as 7th grade. It was wonderful to see others who are working directly in schools and, as always, I was very pleased to talk with language teachers from as far away as San Francisco and Canada.

Every time I meet with people from the Wikipedia community I am struck by how strongly our goals for spreading knowledge and our values of openness, participation, and empowerment align. It is a welcome change of pace from stories about how technology is being used to [surveil whole societies](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/05/edward-snowden-one-year-surveillance-debate-begins-future-privacy) and how the tools of education are being used to [build profiles of children](https://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/data-mining-your-children-106676.html). Now that we have reached the one year anniversary of Edward Snowdenâ€™s revelations I think we can all use a reminder that we *can* have a voice in how the technologies in our lives develop and whether they are used to support our values or undermine them. For myself, interacting with the other participants at WikiConference was that reminder.
