July is all about growing the community here at Wikiotics; last week with my [trip to Washington DC](/blog/2012/06/wikiotics-at-wikimania/) for Wikimania and today with the launch of our P2PU course: “[Build the LLT](https://p2pu.org/en/groups/build-the-last-language-textbook/)“. If you are interested in using Wikiotics or helping to Write the Last Language Textbook but want some help learning the tools, this course is for you. Whether this is your first time helping someone learn language or you teach professionally, [our course](https://p2pu.org/en/groups/build-the-last-language-textbook/) will walk you through the steps.

As the name indicates, the course is part of our [Last Language Textbook](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325184531/http://thelastlanguagetextbook.org/) campaign and will focus on building materials from the [curriculum guide](/group/thelastlanguagetextbook/curriculum) for that project. The course starts today and will run for ten weeks, covering how to develop a basic language lesson, how to use the Wikiotics system to build each of the four lesson types we support ([picture choice](/en/Introduction), [podcast](/user/ian/FSI-Mandarin-Module01-Unit01), [multiple choice](/en/WANY_Hospital_grammar), and [storybook](/en/LittleRedRidingHood)), and how to get additional help from the community.

Enrollment is open and you are all welcome to check out the course materials and sign up here: [https://p2pu.org/en/groups/build-the-last-language-textbook/](https://p2pu.org/en/groups/build-the-last-language-textbook/)
