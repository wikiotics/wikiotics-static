As part of our ongoing [Last Language Textbook](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325183752/http://thelastlanguagetextbook.org/) campaign we will be running a daylong workshop this October 13th to build introductory English language materials to send with the newest [Kids on Computers](https://www.kidsoncomputers.org/) computer lab deployment, to a rural Junior high school in Mexico.

During the workshop we will expand and customize existing lessons, adding our voices, pictures, and experience with English to help some great kids begin their studies. Native English or Spanish speakers, photographers, language teachers, students, and general open education supporters welcome. Lunch of vegetarian dim sum will be provided to participants and the cameras and microphones we use during the day will be given out by lottery at the end of the workshop.

Saturday October 13th  
10:00am-4:00pm  
Adelphi Manhattan campus  
75 Varick Street, Second Floor, New York, NY  
RSVP to contact@wikiotics.org so we can coordinate food ordering.

In addition to the camera and microphones mentioned above we have also secured one of the new [7â€³ Google tablets](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325183752/https://www.google.com/nexus/#/7) for use during the workshop and for one lucky participants to take home after a day of lesson building.
