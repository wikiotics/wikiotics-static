Below is a list of editable FSI lessons in German. They were imported
from <http://fsi-language-courses.org/Content.php?page=German>.

Since anyone is able to edit the lessons below, they may differ
substantially from the [original
lessons](/group/fsi-import/German_lessons).

The lessons below are probably more up-to-date and complete, and you
should really use these, unless you are looking for untouched original
FSI tapes.
