In English, the adjectives are usually placed BEFORE the noun or object
that is being described.

For example:

  - The big house
  - The green apple
  - The fast cars
  - The important man

When the verb "to be" is being used in the sentence, the adjective may
come after the verb to be.

For example:

  - The house is big.
  - The apple is green.
  - The cars are fast.
  - The man is important.

When using adjectives in English, you can also put both an adjective
BEFORE the noun and after the verb "to be".

For example:

  - The big house is blue.
  - The fast cars are new.

In English, adjectives are NEVER plural.

You cannot say: The bigs houses. -or- The bananas are yellows. These are
WRONG\!
