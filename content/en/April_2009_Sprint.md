title = "April 2009 Sprint"
+++

We held a sprint in Pittsburgh April 18-19, during which we made
[considerable
progress](http://code.ductus.us/timeline?from=2009-04-20T00%3A00%3A00-0400).
Participants included:

  - [Jim Garrison](http://jimgarrison.org/)
  - [Ian Sullivan](http://churchkey.org/)

Below is the whiteboard we used for planning the sprint. Once the sprint
began, we moved much of our activity to the [Ductus trac
instance](http://code.ductus.us/).

## Goals for the sprint

  - Create as many [English lessons](/en/English_lessons) as possible
  - Make it easy to fork an English lesson by rewriting the phrases in a
    different language (and possibly changing the pictures) \[we did
    this by script, but the general case is deferred\]
  - Create at least one Chinese lesson \[done\]
  - Improve each of the current Ductus modules (picture \[check\],
    picture\_choice \[check\], and textwiki \[check\]) \[done\]
  - Try to get more people involved, and to get feedback
  - Ductus documentation
  - Future planning \[check\]

### Goals added during the sprint

  - Make it obvious for a user to find a picture's attribution/license
    info.
  - Cache picture resizes/rotations

## Important projects, too big to do during the sprint

  - improve PictureChoiceLesson editing interface
  - license handling
  - user and group wikis (with automatic permissions)

Actually, there are too many things to list here. We started opening
tickets on code.ductus.us. The highest priority items are the ones [we
are aiming to have complete by our 0.1
release](http://code.ductus.us/query?status=!closed&group=component&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&col=reporter&milestone=0.1).
