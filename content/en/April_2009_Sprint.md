## Goals for the sprint

  - Create as many [English lessons](/en/English_lessons) as possible
  - Make it easy to fork an English lesson by rewriting the phrases in a
    different language (and possibly changing the pictures)
  - Create at least one Chinese lesson
  - Improve each of the current Ductus modules (picture \[check\],
    picture\_choice \[check\], and textwiki)
  - Try to get more people involved, and to get feedback
  - Ductus documentation
  - Future planning
