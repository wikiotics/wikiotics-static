place in Pittsburgh, but anyone can get involved by joining \#wikiotics
on FreeNode.

The following people plan to attend the sprint. (Feel free to add your
name.)

    refactor](http://code.ductus.us/wiki/PictureChoiceRefactor)
  - fix code.ductus.us git handling
  - improve PictureChoiceLesson editing interface
  - license handling

Goals for the sprint

  - Create as many English lessons as possible
  - Make it easy to fork an English lesson by rewriting the phrases in a
    different language (and possibly changing the pictures)
  - Try to get more people involved, and to get feedback
  - Ductus documentation
  - Future planning
