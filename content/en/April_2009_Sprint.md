We are holding a sprint April 18-19. Physically, the sprint will take
place in Pittsburgh, but anyone can get involved by joining \#wikiotics
on FreeNode.

The following people plan to attend the sprint. (Feel free to add your
name.)

  - [Jim Garrison](http://jimgarrison.org/)
  - [Ian Sullivan](http://churchkey.org/)

## Goals for the sprint

  - Create as many [English lessons](/en/English_lessons) as possible
  - Make it easy to fork an English lesson by rewriting the phrases in a
    different language (and possibly changing the pictures)
  - Create at least one Chinese lesson
  - Improve each of the current Ductus modules (picture \[check\],
    picture\_choice \[check\], and textwiki)
  - Try to get more people involved, and to get feedback
  - Ductus documentation
  - Future planning

### Goals added during the sprint

  - Make it obvious for a user to find a picture's attribution/license
    info.
  - Cache picture resizes/rotations

## Important projects, too big to do during the sprint

  - improve PictureChoiceLesson editing interface
  - license handling
  - user and group wikis (with automatic permissions)
