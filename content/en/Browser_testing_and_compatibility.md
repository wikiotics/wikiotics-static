Wikiotics will work fully in browsers that support HTML5 with the Vorbis
audio codec. But it should degrade gracefully with limited functionality
in other somewhat recent and popular browsers.

## Browsers we should test

  - Firefox 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.6
  - Internet Explorer 7, 8. (IE6 is not supported.)
  - Chromium
  - Safari 3, 4
  - Opera 10

Eventually we may wish to test each browser on multiple platforms, but
for now testing each browser on any given platform should work.
