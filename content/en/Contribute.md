In addition to:

`<<WikioticsDonateButton>>`

There are plenty of zero cost ways to contribute to Wikiotics. Some
ideas...

## If you have a camera...

  - Take pictures of common objects/situations that could be used in a
    language lesson, and upload them to the [Wikiotics Flickr
    group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/wikiotics/). You'll make lessons
    easier to create and more attractive.

## If you know English...

  - If you have **5 more minutes**, take a look at the existing [English
    lessons](/en/English_lessons) page and see if you can improve some
    existing lessons.
  - If you have **5 more minutes**, [create an account on
    wikiotics.org](/special/create_account) so you can make
    contributions under your name.
  - If you have **20 minutes**, [create or improve an existing
    lesson](/en/make_a_lesson) using photos from Flickr.
  - If you have **1 hour per week**, join the [Wikiotics discussion
    group](http://groups.google.com/group/wikiotics).
  - If you have **free time right now**, [join our chat
    room](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wikiotics) and introduce
    yourself.
  - If you know of other similar or complementary projects, please add
    them to our [Links](/en/Links) page.

## If you are multilingual...

  - If you have **10 minutes**, [translate an existing
    lesson](/en/make_a_lesson) into another language.
  - If you have **1 hour**, please translate the user interface of our
    wiki engine, Ductus, into your language using
    [Transifex](http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/ductus/c/master/).
    If a translation already exists, please make sure it is up-to-date
    and accurate.
  - If you have **15 minutes**, see if you can replace photos in an
    existing lesson with ones that are more culturally appropriate.

## If you are a programmer...

  - If you have **1 hour** and are running a UNIX-like system, try to
    set up a local [Ductus development
    instance](http://code.ductus.us/wiki/DuctusDevelopmentInstance) and
    let us know how it goes.
  - If you have more time, try help improve an upstream project. We have
    filed or are following bugs or feature requests against Django,
    creoleparser, flickrapi, and other projects, and it would be nice
    for everyone if those projects can be improved.
  - Look at the [current tickets for
    Ductus](http://code.ductus.us/query) and see if there is anything
    you can help with.
  - Get involved with design discussions on the mailing list. Currently
    we use the Wikiotics discussion list, but we will create a list
    specifically for Ductus if/when there is enough demand.
