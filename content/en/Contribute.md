There are plenty of ways to contribute to Wikiotics. Some ideas...

## If you know English...

  - If you have **5 minutes**, [register on
    Drumbeat](http://www.drumbeat.org/user/register) and
    [vote](http://www.drumbeat.org/node/29376/about) for us to receive
    the [Mozilla/Shuttleworth open web
    fellowship](http://www.mozilla.org/grants/education-fellowship.html).
  - If you have **5 more minutes**, [create an account on
    wikiotics.org](http://alpha.wikiotics.org/create-account) so you can
    make contributions under your name.
  - \[*coming soon*\] If you have **30 minutes**, [create or improve an
    English lesson](/en/make_a_lesson) using existing photos
  - If you have **2 hours**, take some photos of common
    objects/situations that could be used in a language lesson, and
    upload them to the [Wikiotics Flickr
    group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/wikiotics/).
  - If you have **1 hour per week**, join the [Wikiotics discussion
    group](http://groups.google.com/group/wikiotics).
  - If you have **free time right now**, [join our chat
    room](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wikiotics) and introduce
    yourself.
  - If you know of other similar or complementary projects, please add
    them to our [Links](/en/Links) page.

## If you are multilingual...

  - \[*coming soon*\] If you have **30 minutes**, translate an existing
    English lesson into another language.
  - If you have **1 hour**, please translate the user interface of our
    wiki engine, Ductus, into your language using
    [Transifex](http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/ductus/c/master/).
    If a translation already exists, please make sure it is up-to-date
    and accurate.
  - \[*coming soon*\] If you have **30 minutes**, see if you can replace
    photos in an existing lesson with ones that are more culturally
    appropriate.

## If you are a programmer...

  - If you have **1 hour** and are running a UNIX-like system, try to
    set up a local [Ductus development
    instance](http://code.ductus.us/wiki/DuctusDevelopmentInstance) and
    let us know how it goes.
  - If you have more time, try help improve an upstream project. We have
    filed or are following bugs or feature requests against Django,
    creoleparser, flickrapi, and other projects, and it would be nice
    for everyone if those projects can be improved.
  - Look at the [current tickets for
    Ductus](http://code.ductus.us/query) and see if there is anything
    you can help with.
  - Get involved with design discussions on the mailing list. Currently
    we use the Wikiotics discussion list, but we will create a list
    specifically for Ductus if/when there is enough demand.
