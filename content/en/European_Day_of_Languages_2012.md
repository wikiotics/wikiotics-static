Welcome to Wikiotics\!

We're taking the European Day of Languages 2012, on September 26, to
call for help translating some of our favourite lessons to more
languages.

Pick one of the lessons below, and translate it to whatever language you
know. Tag it with **EDL2012** so it shows up in the listing below.

And feel free to share the result of your work on facebook, twitter or
whatever you use\!

`<<PageList tags=EDL2012>>`
