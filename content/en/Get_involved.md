title = "Getting Involved"
+++

Wikiotics is a community effort in collaborative language instruction.
If you want to get involved, take a look at the [Learn a
language](/en/Take_a_lesson) and [Teach a language](/en/Make_a_lesson)
pages to find out how our existing lessons are made and what they cover.
New material and new takes on old material are always welcome.

In addition to creating and using language lessons, there are many other
ways to contribute to the community.

## Join up\!

We can always use more community members. Please take a moment and
[Create an account](/special/create_account). Not only will that give
you access to your own [User Pages](/en/User_Pages), an area of the wiki
that only you can edit, it will also give you an account on our [Bug
Tracker](http://code.ductus.us/), where you can report any problems you
find with the technology or new features you would like to see us build.

**Drumbeat project** / **project blog**: We have an [active project
page](https://www.drumbeat.org/project/wikiotics-tools-and-materials-collaborative-language-education)
in Mozilla's community building [Drumbeat](https://www.drumbeat.org)
system. This is where we keep the [project's
blog](https://www.drumbeat.org/project/wikiotics-tools-and-materials-collaborative-language-education/blog)
and we have also applied for a [grant of
support](http://www.mozilla.org/grants/education-fellowship.html) based
on our project there, so do check it out.

**Discussion Mailing List**: Our [mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/wikiotics) is run through Google
Groups and open for anyone who would like to discuss Wikiotics.

## Help with pictures

The most time consuming part of building a new picture choice lesson is
finding appropriate pictures. There are millions of pictures available
and finding one to clearly illustrate you particular sentences can be
difficult.

To help make lesson creation easier we started a [flickr
group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/wikiotics/) to collect and tag
photos for use in language lessons. When you are making or editing a
lesson, you can choose to restrict your flickr searches to just pictures
in this group, greatly speeding the search.

The more pictures in this group, and the better they are tagged, the
easier it is to build lessons. If you have time, please consider going
to the [flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/wikiotics/) and
tagging some of the pictures there, or take some more yourself and add
them to the group. All contributions are welcome.

## Make things beautiful

Most of us building Wikiotics are very function-focused and we would
love to hear from anyone from the community with more of a focus on how
beautiful the site can be. Anything from hand-drawn logos, to css
suggestions, to full blown interaction design mockups, are quite
welcome. If you see something that could be more beautiful, we'd welcome
your help to make that happen.

## Software Development

This site, and all of the lessons on it, would not be possible without a
custom structured wiki system called [ductus](http://ductus.us/). All
the work going to enhance basic features of the Wikiotics system,
develop new kinds of lesson templates, support new formats, and add new
features for the site, all of that is software development work being
done on ductus. The more help we get, the more of it we can build.

If you are interested in helping to improve the basic capabilities of
Wikiotics, we would be happy to [hear from
you](http://alpha.wikiotics.org/wiki/contact).

For a gauge of project activity at any given time, see this site's
[recent changes](/special/recent_changes) or the [Ductus development
timeline](http://code.ductus.us/timeline).

## Wikiotics Foundation

The Wikiotics site, and development of the Ductus software, are
supported by the non-profit [Wikiotics
Foundation](/en/Wikiotics_Foundation). If you would like to contribute
to the foundation, please contact: ***donate@wikiotics.org***. The
Wikiotics Foundation has 501(c)(3), making such contributions
tax-deductible in the United States.
