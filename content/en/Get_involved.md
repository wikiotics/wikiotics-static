title = "Getting Involved"
+++

Wikiotics is a community effort in collaborative language instruction.
If you want to get involved, take a look at the [Take a
lesson](/en/Take_a_lesson) and [Make a lesson](/en/Make_a_lesson) pages
to find out how our existing lessons are made and what they cover. New
material and new takes on old material are always welcome.

In addition to creating and using language lessons, there are many other
ways to contribute to the community.

## Flickr Group

The most time consuming part of building a new picture choice lesson is
finding appropriate pictures. Even focusing only on the appropriately
licensed pictures, as we must to make the kind of creative materials we
need on the site, there are still millions of pictures available and
finding one to clearly illustrate you particular sentences can be
difficult.

To help make lesson creation easier we started a [flickr
group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/wikiotics/) for interested
photographers. If you like taking pictures, please consider adding some
to the group collection. Pictures of any kind are welcome, as long as
they are licensed Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or Attribution
Share Alike (CC-BY-SA) though photos with easily determined subjects are
particularly useful for the simple sentences used in our introductory
[picture choice lessons](/en/English_Lesson_-_Introduction)).

## Software Development

This site, and all of the lessons on it, would not be possible without
[ductus](http://ductus.us/), the structured wiki software behind
everything we build. All the work going to enhance basic features of the
Wikiotics system, developing new kinds of lesson templates, supporting
new formats, and adding new features for the site, all of that is
software development work being done on ductus.

For a gauge of project activity at any given time, see this site's
[recent changes](/en/special/recent_changes) or the [Ductus development
timeline](http://code.ductus.us/timeline).

If you are interested in helping to improve the basic capabilities of
Wikiotics, we would be happy to [hear from
you](http://alpha.wikiotics.org/wiki/contact).

#### Compatibility

In the end, all lessons should work from a person's [web
browser](/en/Browser_testing_and_compatibility), whether that person is
using a desktop computer or a mobile device.
