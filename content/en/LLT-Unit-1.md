If you have never studied English before this is the place to start. The
following 15 audio lessons cover the basic interactions you need to
participate in your first conversation with a native speaker. You will
learn how to introduce yourself, ask someone's name, exchange basic
biographical information, and talk about your studies, everything you
should need to participate in a language meetup in your area.

The lessons below are organized around four main topics. The lessons
within each topic should be listened to in order but you can move
between topics however you wish. So if you listen to the first two
lessons in "Talking about language studies" and want a change of pace,
you can move to the first lesson in "Introducing yourself". You could
even start by listening to the first lesson on each topic. What you want
to learn is up to you.
