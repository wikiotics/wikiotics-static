    Translation](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7004)
    plugin for Firefox. Uses proprietary web services to actually do the
    translation, but it provides a good interface for looking up words
    from a web page. Maybe some day we can provide our own translation
    web service, whether it is edited by humans or [assembled as a
    result of machine
    learning](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/implementing-statistical-machine-translation-using-mapreduce/).
