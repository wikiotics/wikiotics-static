    exists in many languages
  - [BabelFish Instant
    Translation](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7004)
    plugin for Firefox. Uses proprietary web services to actually do the
    translation, but it provides a good interface for looking up words
    from a web page. Maybe some day we can provide our own translation
    web service, whether it is edited by humans or [assembled as a
    result of machine
    learning](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/implementing-statistical-machine-translation-using-mapreduce/).
    (Actually, building such services is probably beyond the scope of
    Wikiotics, but it would be nice if they existed anyway.)
  - [Foreign Service Language
    Classes](http://fsi-language-courses.org/Content.php) Has many
    language lessons developed by the US Government, and thus in the
    public domain. These are full introductory circuli for many
    languages.
  - <http://translatewiki.net/> is the translation effort for MediaWiki
  - [Tatoeba](http://tatoeba.org/) "At its core, Tatoeba is a large
    database of example sentences translated into several languages. But
    as a whole, it is much more than that."
  - [Anki](http://ichi2.net/anki/) is a free software flashcard system.
  - [Mnemosyne](http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/) is a free software
    flashcard system.
