## Picture Choice Lessons

The resources provided by Wikiotics are meant to help both teachers and
students involved in language learning.

So far, we have built a "picture choice" lesson type (see [a sample
English lesson](/en/Introduction)), which is a flexible format for
helping to improve a student's vocabulary and naturally introduce basic
grammar.

If you want to create a new lesson to test out the system, simply add a
new link to any existing page and save the page. When you follow the
link you will be presented with a series of options about what you want
the new page to be. Select the "picture choice lesson" and start filling
in your lesson information into the form that will appear.

The form asks for the sentences you want to teach and for the pictures
you want to use to teach those sentences.

#### Editing

This is a wiki so each page has an edit button at the top. From there
you can rearrange in what order the individual picture choice groups are
presented to students. You can also add additional materials to the
lesson or change the text accompanying any existing pictures. We are
working to improve the capabilities of this interface to make editing
more powerful and allow you to remove picture choice groups from
existing lessons.

#### Translate

If you want to translate a page, simply load it and use the "copy" tab
at the top of the page and move it to a new location. Once the lesson
has been moved, click on the "edit" button and replace the text with
corresponding text in a new language. When you're done, share your
lesson by adding a link to some of the pages listing lessons by language
like [English lessons](/en/English_lessons), [Spanish
lessons](/en/Spanish_lessons), or [Chinese
lessons](/en/Chinese_lessons).

For example, I liked the English lesson about different [weather
types](/en/Weather) and I wanted to make a Spanish version. So I went to
the lesson page and clicked on "copy." When it asked me where to move
the lesson I entered "es:El tiempo" and hit enter, which brought me to
the new [Spanish weather lesson](/es/El_tiempo). At this point my
Spanish lesson was still in English so I hit the "edit" button and
started translating. Since I want to share this new lesson I added it to
the [Spanish lessons](/en/Spanish_lessons) page. That's it.
