## Picture Choice Lessons

The resources provided by Wikiotics are meant to help both teachers and
students involved in language learning.

So far, we have built a "picture choice" lesson type (see [a sample
English lesson](/en/English_Lesson_-_Introduction)), which is a flexible
format for helping to improve a student's vocabulary and naturally
introducing basic grammar.

If you want to create a new lesson to test out the system, simply add a
new link to any existing page and save the page. When you follow the
link you will be presented with a series of options about what you want
the new page to be. Select the "picture choice lesson" and start filling
in your lesson information into the form that will appear.

The form asks for the sentences you want to teach and for the pictures
you want to use to teach those sentences.

#### Editing

Each lesson page has an edit button that allows you to edit the lesson.
From there you can rearrange in what order the individual picture choice
groups are presented to students. You can also add additional materials
to the lesson.
