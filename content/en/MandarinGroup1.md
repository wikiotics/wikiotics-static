Welcome to the study of Mandarin Chinese\!

This page presents a collection of lessons designed for first time
students of the language. The material presented here is what you would
likely cover in the first week or two of formal instruction and covers
basic vocabulary and how to ask someone's name. In the course of
learning this material, you will be exposed to simple sentence
structures and some of the other features of the Chinese language that
will be used through out your study. Anything you encounter here that is
not explained fully will be covered in future lessons.
