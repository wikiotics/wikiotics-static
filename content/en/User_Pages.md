When you [create an account](/special/create_account) on Wikiotics, we
create a user page area just for you.

Think of user pages as a personal wiki section. No one else can edit
pages in your section so you can build or collect lessons there and know
that they will always stay as you left them. Feel free to copy any other
lessons on your user pages and tinker with them, or build your own
material to share with students and colleagues.

If you want to copy a page into your user page section:

1.  Open the page you want to copy
2.  Click on the "copy" tab at the top of the page
3.  In the "`Target page name`" box enter "`user:YOURUSER/PageName`"

So, if my user name is [ian](/user/ian/about) and I want to copy the
community-built [Weather](/en/Weather) lesson over to my user page
section and call it IntroWeather, I would enter this into the copy box
`user:ian/IntroWeather`

While only you can edit pages in your user page section, other people
are able to view and copy your lessons as usual. This keeps your
materials exactly as you left them for your own use, or for the use of
any students and colleagues, while still allowing the community to
benefit from and respect your contributions.

since we are still implementing index and search functionality for the
site,

If you would like to make it easier for other users to find your
lessons, consider making a page to keep track of all your lessons like
[this one](/user/ian/Lessons) and adding it to our [Community
List](/en/Community_List).
