"[We Are New
York](http://www.nyc.gov/html/weareny/html/videos/videos.shtml)" is an
series of television episodes produced as a resource for students of
English as a second language (ESL). Episodes focus on everyday
situations and interactions, but all of the characters speak more slowly
than normal to aid comprehension by students.

On this page we're putting together supporting lessons that focus on the
basic vocabulary from the episodes to help people prepare for new
episodes and practice material from old ones.
