We are using this page to talk about the [Weather](/en/Weather) lesson
and how we can improve the pictures it uses.

Please add a link to your own version of the page below and we will meet
online at the end of the week and pull the bits of each version that
people like best into the main lesson.

![Warm dog](/en/Warm_dog?view=image&max_size=250,250 "Warm dog")

I liked the dog w/ heat lamp for "warm" mostly because it was the only
one even remotely appropriate that showed up while searching for "warm"
on flickr and I couldn't think of other terms to search for that would
illustrate the concept. Do other people like that? What are some other
ideas for something to illustrate "warm"? -Ian
