## Project Vision

We aim to become a hub for free online language instruction by providing
easy to use tools that help the community create high quality materials.

The initial [project vision](/en/project_vision) should give a feel for
what we are working on and where we are going. We are also trying to
start a list of [similar and complementary projects](/en/Links) that can
be useful during the language-learning process.

If you are interested, the easiest way to help is to use the site and
let us know what you think. Other ways to help are listed on the [Get
Involved](/en/Get_involved) page.

## Wikiotics Foundation

The [Wikiotics Foundation](/en/Wikiotics_Foundation) is a nonprofit
organization dedicated to the development and distribution to the
public, at no charge, of software tools and materials for collaborative
language instruction. The organization has applied for 501(c)(3) status,
which if granted will make certain contributions tax-deductible.
