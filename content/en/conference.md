# What is Wikiotics?

Wikiotics is a new tool for building re-mixable interactive language
lessons and sharing them with the world. We aim to bring instruction in
every language to everyone. Take a look at our sample lesson:

If you can read this, you can teach someone. Help the world learn how to
talk to you and perhaps it will return the favor.

You can find out more from our main project page <http://wikiotics.org>,
our [project blog](http://blog.wikiotics.org), and out [Get
involved](/en/Get_involved) page.

## What is underneath the hood?

Wikiotics is powered by a structured-content wiki named
<http://ductus.us> that is capable of supporting many other types of
lessons. Over the summer we'll be overhauling our user interface and
making it possible to create multiple types of lessons and easily
convert material between them.
