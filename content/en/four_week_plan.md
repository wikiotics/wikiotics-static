We are trying to do four weeks of different "pushes" in the four weeks
before the Shuttleworth/Drumbeat proposal is due. Each week's push will
be introduced by a blog post on the Drumbeat site.

## Week 1 (September 19)

Translation Push: Translate the intro lesson into as many languages as
possible

Goal: Have as many translations as we can get

## Week 2 (September 26)

Picture Hunt: Find the best pictures for the most common conversation
topic: the weather

Goal: Turn the weather lesson into the clearest lesson pictures can
paint

## Week 3 (October 3)

What is a flash card: Replace the pictures of an existing lesson on
adjectives to better illustrate the lesson terms for you.

Goal: Have many forked versions of the same lesson.

## Week 4 (October 10)

Share your words: Create a lesson to teach others some of the special
vocabulary from your daily life. Maybe it is the type of foods and
furniture you use, or the environment you live in, or some special terms
used at work.

Goal: Have many lessons of specialized vocabulary
