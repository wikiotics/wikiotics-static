Creating a lesson takes three simple steps, each of which we will go
over here.

  - **Step 1**: Go to the [new lesson page](/new) and click on the type
    of lesson you want to create.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Step 2**: Add text, audio, or pictures to your lesson.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Step 3**: Save your lesson on the wiki.

Let's look at each of these steps in more detail.

## Step 1: Making a new lesson

The [new lesson page](/new), which is also available from the main
wikiotics.org page in the "Teach" bubble, lists every type of lesson you
can create on Wikiotics. Currently you can build text pages like this
one and four types of interactive lessons:

**[Picture choice](/en/Introduction)**: Here students try and match a
text and/or audio prompt with one picture out of a group.

**[Podcast](/user/ian/FSI-Mandarin-Module01-Unit01)**: This is an
audio-only lesson suitable for streaming online or downloading for
offline use.

**[Phrase choice](/en/WANY_Hospital_grammar)**: This is a text-based
multiple choice lesson.

**[Storybook](/en/LittleRedRidingHood)**: This format lets you create a
picture book to tell a story or illustrate language usage.

Once you know what kind of lesson you want to create, clicking on the
appropriate icon from the [new lesson page](/new) will create a new
lesson of that type and open an editor window in that lesson for you.

## Step 2: Adding content to your lesson

## Step 3: Save your lesson on the wiki
