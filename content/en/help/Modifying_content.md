If you spot a mistake while going through a lesson, or find something
you would like to add, click the "edit" link at the bottom of the lesson
page.

This will take you to the editor, where you can change the content as
you wish. The editor depends on what type of content you are editing.
Below are links to detailed instructions about each of them:

  - [text pages](/en/help/Editing_wikitext_pages)
  - [podcast lessons and choice
    lessons](/en/help/Editing_flashcard_deck_lessons)

Once you have finished editing, save your work, and your changes will be
available to every user immediately.
