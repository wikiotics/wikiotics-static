## Instructions for chatting

Our chat room is \#wikiotics on the FreeNode IRC network.

If your browser supports Javascript, you can [click here to begin
chatting immediately](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wikiotics).

If you would like to download an IRC client, here are some instructions
for getting online quickly. First, download
[Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/). In the new accounts dialog box, add an
account with the following information:

  - Protocol: IRC
  - Username: \[choose a nickname here\]
  - Server: chat.freenode.net
  - Password: \[blank\]

You should now be able to connect to FreeNode. Once it connects, it
should open a window of conversation with "freenode-connect." In this
window, type the command "/join \#wikiotics" to join our chat room.

At this point you may wish to save the room to your buddy list for
future use: choose the "Add" command from under the "Conversation" menu.
You may also wish to click the checkbox that allows you to auto-join
when the account goes online.
