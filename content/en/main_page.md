Wikiotics is a web site for collaborating on language instruction
materials. We aim to become a hub for free online language instruction.

The resources provided by Wikiotics are meant to help both teachers and
students involved with learning a language. So far, we have built a
"picture choice" lesson type (see [a sample English
lesson](/en/English_Lesson_-_Introduction)), which is a flexible format
for helping to improve a student's vocabulary. We are working to improve
[the wiki software of this site](http://ductus.us/) so that these
lessons (and others) can be edited more easily. In the end, all lessons
should work from a person's [web
browser](/en/Browser_testing_and_compatibility), though people are free
to develop new and innovative interfaces for other devices and platforms
(such as phones).

The [Wikiotics Foundation](/en/Wikiotics_Foundation) is a nonprofit
organization dedicated to the development and distribution to the
public, at no charge, of software tools and materials for collaborative
language instruction. The organization has applied for 501(c)(3) status,
which if granted will make certain contributions tax-deductible.

For more information about why the project was started, the initial
[project vision](/en/project_vision) should give a feel for what we are
working on and where we are going. We are also trying to start a list of
[similar and complementary projects](/en/Links) that can be useful
during the language-learning process.
