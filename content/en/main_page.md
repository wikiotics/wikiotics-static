Wikiotics is a web site for collaborating on language instruction
materials.

View [a sample English lesson](/en/English_Lesson_-_Introduction) or
read the initial [project vision](/en/project_vision) to get a feel for
what we are working on.

We are working to improve the wiki software of this site so that lessons
can b<http://alpha.wikiotics.org/wiki/front_page?view=edite> edited more
easily.

## Get involved

Our chat room is \#wikiotics on the FreeNode IRC network. (see

We also have a [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/wikiotics).

  - [BabelFish Instant
    Translation](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7004)
    plugin for Firefox. Uses proprietary web services to actually do the
    translation, but it provides a good interface for looking up words
    from a web page. Maybe some day we can provide our own translation
    web service, whether it is edited by humans or [assembled as a
    result of machine
    learning](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/implementing-statistical-machine-translation-using-mapreduce/).
