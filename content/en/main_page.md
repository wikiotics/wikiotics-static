Wikiotics is a new type of tool for building interactive language
lessons using rich multimedia elements. We aim to make lessons as easy
to create, customize, and re-mix as editing a wiki page.

## [Learn a language](/en/Take_a_lesson)

`<<WikioticsLanguageList>>`

This is where you will find our community-built language lessons. Some
lessons are also available from the personal pages of our individual
[community members](/en/Community_List).

## [Teach a language](/en/Make_a_lesson)

If you can read this, you know enough to help someone learn a language.
Why not give lesson building a shot? Take a look at our [Make a
lesson](/en/Make_a_lesson) page for How To information and tips.

## [Get involved](/en/Get_involved)

If you like what you see and want to help, there are lots of ways to get
involved. Check out our [Get involved](/en/Get_involved) page for some
ways you can help out the community.

For more information about the project, take a look at the
[about](/group/wikiotics/about) page and feel free to [contact
us](/en/contact).
