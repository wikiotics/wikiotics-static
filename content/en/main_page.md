Wikiotics is a web site for collaborating on language instruction
materials.

View [a sample English lesson](/en/English_Lesson_-_Introduction) or
read the initial [project vision](/en/project_vision) to get a feel for
what we are working on.

We are working to improve the wiki software of this site so that lessons
can be edited more easily.

## Get involved

Our chat room is \#wikiotics on the FreeNode IRC network. (see
