Wikiotics is a community effort at collaborative language instruction.

else, or helping develop innovative tools for either task, just follow

This is where you will find our community-built language lessons.  
Some lessons are also available from personal [User
Pages](/en/User_Pages).

### Activity focus

This week (October 26-November 2) we are trying to build as many
versions of our first [Adjectives](/en/Adjectives) lesson as possible.
See [Ian's blog post](https://www.drumbeat.org/content/lessons-just-you)
for instructions and [Ian's version](/user/ian/Adjectives) of the lesson
for an example.

We have applied for a joint [Mozilla/Shuttleworth Foundation
