Wikiotics is a community effort at collaborative language instruction.
If you are interested in learning a language, teaching one to someone
else, or helping to develop innovative tools for either task, just
follow the links below.

This is where you will find our community-built language lessons. Some
lessons are also available from personal [User Pages](/en/User_Pages).

If you want to help someone learn a language, whether that is
