Wikiotics is a web site for collaborating on language instruction
materials.

View a [sample lesson](/en/English_Lesson_-_Introduction) or read the
initial [project vision](/en/project_vision) to get a feel for what we
are working on.

## Get involved

We held a sprint April 18-19. See [April 2009
Sprint](/en/April_2009_Sprint) for details.

Our chat room is \#wikiotics on the FreeNode IRC network. (see
[instructions for chatting](/en/instructions_for_chatting))

We also have a [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/wikiotics).

## Lessons by language

  - [English lessons](/en/English_lessons)
  - [Spanish lessons](/en/Spanish_lessons)

The interface for editing lessons is not very good, but we hope to fix
this soon.
