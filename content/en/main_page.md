Wikiotics is a new type of tool for building interactive language
lessons using rich multimedia elements. We aim to make lessons as easy
to create, customize, and re-mix as editing a wiki page.

## Learn a language

`<<WikioticsLanguageList>>`

This is where you will find our community-built language lessons. Some
lessons are also available from the personal pages of our individual
[community members](/en/Community_List).

## Teach a language

If you can read this, you know enough to help someone learn a language.
Each page on this site has an "edit" button, or you can [create a brand
new lesson](/en/Make_a_lesson).

## Get involved

If you like what you see and want to help, there are [many ways to get
involved](/en/Get_involved).

For more information about the project, take a look at the
[about](/group/wikiotics/about) page and feel free to [contact
us](/en/contact).
