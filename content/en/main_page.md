Wikiotics is a new type of tool for building interactive language
lessons using rich multimedia elements. We aim to make lessons as easy
to create, customize, and re-mix as editing a wiki page.

## [Learn a language](/en/Take_a_lesson)

This is where you will find our community-built language lessons. Some
lessons are also available from personal [User Pages](/en/User_Pages).

## [Teach a language](/en/Make_a_lesson)

If you want to help someone learn a language, whether that is
[English](/en/English_lessons) or any other, take a look at our [Make a
lesson](/en/Make_a_lesson) page. Also check out our [Lesson Building
Tips](/en/Lesson_Building_Tips) page for some useful hints.

## [Get involved](/en/Get_involved)

If you like what you see and want to help, check out our
[Contribute](/en/Contribute) page for some ways you can help out the
community.

For more information about the project, take a look at the
[about](/group/wikiotics/about) page and feel free to [contact
us](/en/contact).
