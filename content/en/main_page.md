Wikiotics is a community effort at collaborative language instruction.
If you are interested in learning a language, teaching one to someone
else, or helping to develop innovative tools for either task, just
follow the links below.

## [Learn a language](/en/Take_a_lesson)

This is where you will find our community-built language lessons. Some
lessons are also available from personal [User Pages](/en/User_Pages).

## [Teach a language](/en/Make_a_lesson)

If you want to help someone learn a language, whether that is English or
any other, take a look at our [Make a lesson](/en/Make_a_lesson) page.
Also check out our [Lesson Building Tips](/en/Lesson_Building_Tips) page
