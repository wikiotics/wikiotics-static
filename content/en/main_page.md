Wikiotics is part of the global language community dedicated to making
learning in every language possible for everyone. To make that possible,
this site is a new type of tool for building interactive language
lessons using rich multimedia elements. We aim to make lessons easy to
create, customize, and re-mix for everyone. If you know or want to know
a language, you have something to contribute.

## Learn a language

Click on a language to begin learning:

`<<WikioticsLanguageList>>`

This is where you will find our community-built language lessons. Some
lessons are also available from the personal pages of our individual
[community members](/en/Community_List).

## Teach a language

If you can read this, you know enough to help someone learn a language.
Each page on this site has an "edit" button. Try improving a lesson or
translating it to a different language. Or, you can make a new lesson
from scratch.

  - [Get started creating a new lesson](/new/flashcard_deck)
  - [Read instructions about editing and creating
    lessons](/en/Make_a_lesson)

## Get involved

If you like what you see and want to help, there are [many ways to get
involved](/en/Get_involved).
