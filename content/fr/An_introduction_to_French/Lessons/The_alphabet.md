French is based on the Latin alphabet (also called the Roman alphabet),
and there are twenty-six (26) letters. Originally there were twenty-five
(25) letters, with 'W' being added by the mid-nineteenth century. Unlike
the English, who call it a "double-u," the French use "double-v" and
pronounce it (doo-bluh-vay) after the 'V' which is pronounced (vay).
During the period from Old French to Modern French, the letter 'K' was
added. These two letters are used mostly with adopted foreign words. The
French alphabet used today is less than 200 years old.

The twenty-six letters are parted into :

  - 20 Consonants (Consonnes): B C D F G H J K L M N P Q R S T V W X Z
  - 6 Vowels (Voyelles): A E I O U Y

In addition, French uses several accents: grave accents (à, è, and ù)
and acute accents (é). A circumflex applies to all vowels, except Y
(considered as a vowel): â, ê, î, ô, û. A tréma (French for dieresis) is
also applied: ë, ï, ü, ÿ. Two combined letters (called orthographic
ligatures) are used: æ and œ. Finally, a cedilla is used on the c to
make it sound like an English s: ç.

## Punctuation

The punctuation symbols in French operates very similarly to English
with the same meaning. The only punctuation symbol not present in French
would be the quotation marks; these are replaced by the guillemets shown
in the table above. For speech in fiction, no quotation marks are used.
The two stroke punctuation marks (such as ;, :, ?, \!) may require a
non-breaking space before or after the mark in question.

See the [full table of punctuation marks with their
pronunciation](/fr/An_introduction_to_French/Lessons/The_alphabet/Punctuation).

## Diacritics (accents)

Five different kinds of accent marks are used in written French. In many
cases, an accent changes the sound of the letter to which it is added.
In others, the accent has no effect on pronunciation. Accents in French
never indicate stress (which always falls on the last syllable).
Accentuated letters are usually never followed by a double consonant
(except châssis for instance); moreover on e accent becomes useless
because a following double consonant changes its pronounciation (e.g.:
jeter (\[ə\],throw) but je jette (pronounced è, I throw). The following
table lists every French accent mark and the letters with which it can
be combined:

<tr class="odd">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note that the letter ÿ is only used in very rare words, mostly old town
names like L'Haÿ-Les-Roses, a Paris surburb or Aÿ in Champagne region.
This letter is pronounced like ï.

Note also that as of the spelling reform of 1990, the diaresis
indicating gu is not a digraph on words finishing in guë and is now
placed on the u in standard (académie française) French: aigüe and not
aiguë; cigüe and not ciguë; ambigüe and not ambiguë. Since this reform
is relatively recent and mostly unknown to laypeople, the two spellings
can be used interchangeably.

### Acute accent - Accent aigu

The acute accent is the most common accent used in written French. It is
only used with the letter e and is always pronounced /e/ (ay).

One use of the accent aigu is to form the past participle of regular -er
verbs.

### Grave accent - Accent grave

#### à and ù

In the case of the letters à and ù, the grave accent is used to
graphically distinguish one word from another.

<th>With accent grave</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>a (3rd pers. sing of avoir, to have)</td>
<td>à (preposition, to, at, etc.)</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>la (definite article for feminine nouns)</td>
<td>là (there)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ou (conjunction, or)</td>
<td>où (where)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### è

Unlike à and ù, è is not used to distinguish words from one another. The
è is used for pronunciation. In careful speech, an unaccented e is
pronounced like an a on the end of a word in English /ə/, as in
"Angela", and in rapid speech is sometimes not pronounced at all. The è
is pronounced like the letter e in pet.

### Circumflex accent - Accent circonflexe

This accent is often called a 'hat' in language and mathematics, and
usually indicates the disappearance of the old-French s after the vowel
wearing it (the hat) but this s can still be found in a noun or a verb
of the same lexical family. Examples are: hospital --\> hôpital but
hospitalité, maistre --\> maître, gâteau from old french gastel, ê is
pronounced like è: Fenestre --\> fenêtre but défenestrer, forest --\>
forêt but forestier.

Circumflex accent may be used to have closed-o (la Drôme (French
department), un dôme... ô is pronounced \[o\] like in château, whithout
this accent it would be said like the english word hot ; whereas this
pronunciation is not really applied in the south of France.)

In past participle of devoir (must), dû a circumflex accent is written
to distinguish it with the article du.

According to the spelling reform of 1990 some of circumflex accent are
not compulsory any more (maître --\> maitre, boîte --\> boite...)

### Cedilla - Cédille

The cedilla is used only with the letter c, and is said to make the c
soft, making it equivalent to the English and French s.
