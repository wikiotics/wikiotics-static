***Note*: this is work in progress**

To an English speaker, the number of conjugations of French verbs can
look quite daunting. Fortunately, day to day language only requires a
limited number of them.

## Modes

French has several "modes" for verbs.

  - Infinitive: the form you find in dictionaries. It is roughly
    equivalent to the English infinitive (the "to work" form).
  - Indicative: used to indicate actual actions, whether past, present
    or future.
  - Conditional: simply put, the mode you'll use after an "if"
    statement. This mode indicates that something will happen under a
    certain condition.
  - Subjunctive: this is probably the trickiest mode. It is usually used
    to mark wish/will, judgement, necessity, etc...
  - Imperative: as in English, this is the mode to give orders.

## Regular verbs

French regular verbs are split in 3 groups:

  - First group: verbs whose infinitive ends in "-er" (except "aller").
    They are conjugated like [marcher](/fr/Marcher_conjugations).
  - Second group: verbs whose infinitive ends in "-ir". The typical
    example is "finir" (to finish).
  - Third group: everything else, with infinitives usually ending in
    "-re" or "-oir".
