To an English speaker, the number of conjugations of French verbs can
look quite daunting. Fortunately, day to day language only requires a
limited number of them.

## Modes

French has several "modes" for verbs.

  - Infinitive: the form you find in dictionaries. It is roughly
    equivalent to the English infinitive (the "to work" form).
  - Indicative: used to indicate actual actions, whether past, present
    or future.
  - Conditional: simply put, the mode you'll use after an "if"
    statement. This mode indicates that something will happen under a
    certain condition.
  - Subjunctive: this is probably the trickiest mode. It is usually used
    to mark wish/will, judgement, necessity, etc...
  - Imperative: as in English, this is the mode to give orders.

## Tenses

The indicative mode boasts 8 different tenses, but not all are commonly
used in conversation.

Here is a short summary of each of them:

  - **présent**: the present tense is used as an equivalent to both the
    English *present simple* and *present continuous*
  - **imparfait**: used to indicate actions that last in the past, or in
    certain constructions to indicate simultaneous actions in the past.
  - **passé composé**: the most commonly used tense for verbs in the
    past in spoken French.
  - **futur simple** or **futur**: equivalent to the English *will +
    verb*.
  - **passé simple**: while very common in writing, it sounds quite
    formal in spoken French. French speakers usually prefer to use
    **passé composé** when speaking.
  - **plus-que-parfait**: mostly used for the *concordance des temps* in
    the past.
  - **passé antérieur**: rarely used in modern French.
  - **futur antérieur**: used to indicate that an action will happen
    before another one in the future.

## Irregular verbs

Many common verbs are irregular.

  - **être**: to be ([conjugations](/fr/Etre_conjugations))
  - **avoir**: to have ([conjugations](/fr/Avoir_conjugations))

## Regular verbs

French regular verbs are split in 3 groups:

  - First group: verbs whose infinitive ends in "-er" (except "aller").
    They are conjugated like [marcher](/fr/Marcher_conjugations).
  - Second group: verbs whose infinitive ends in "-ir". The typical
    example is "finir" (to finish).
  - Third group: everything else, with infinitives usually ending in
    "-re" or "-oir".
