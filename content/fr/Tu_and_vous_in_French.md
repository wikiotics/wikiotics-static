Like many other languages (not including English), French uses 2
distinct forms of address for the second person. Where in English, one
can only use **you**, French has two forms:

  - **tu** is the informal way of addressing a person. It is the same
    for both [masculine and
    feminine](/fr/Masculine_and_feminine_in_French).
  - **vous** is the formal equivalent of **tu**. It is the same form as
    the plural second person form.

Depending on which form you decide to use, the grammar in your sentence
will change, most notably the verb form. For instance, when greeting
someone, you can say **comment allez-vous?** or **comment vas-tu?**.
Notice how the verb *aller* (to go) changes.

## Usage

The exact rules for using these two forms are not always clear, and can
even vary from country to country.

The following points describe the usage in France.

Use of **tu** and **vous** is not always symetrical. For instance,
pupils in school would normally address their teacher with **vous**,
while the teacher would use **tu**. Similar situations can happen where
a hierarchical gap exists between the two speakers, for instance at
work.

The following rules of thumb should avoid any gross mistake:

  - Always use the formal **vous** in shops, restaurants and bars.
  - If you are talking to officials (customs, administration...), or to
    the police, always use the formal **vous**.
  - Younger people will use **tu** more easily. In informal settings,
    like when meeting friends, **tu** is the norm.
  - If you don't know which one to use, play safe, and say **vous**. If
    it is ok to say **tu**, you will usually be told so.
  - If you do not know the formal verb form, it is better to use
    **vous** anyways along with an incorrect verb. This will simply
    sound like a grammar mistake, whereas saying **tu** could sound
    rude.

## Local variations

  - Belgian French speakers tend to use **tu** more liberally than in
    France. It is quite common to be addressed as **tu** even in formal
    settings there, like at work.
  - If you read old books or watch old French films, you may come across
    wider use of **vous**, for instance between family members (husband
    and wife, children to parents...) or between close friends. Read
    ''Les Mis√©rables'' by Victor Hugo for examples of such use. This
    does sound very old and outdated nowadays.
