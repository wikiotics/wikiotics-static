One of the great strengths of building language materials online is how
easy it is to add audio recordings so that students can practice
listening to and understanding different native speakers. If you have a
microphone on your computer, you can help us record some of the [example
sentences](/group/thelastlanguagetextbook/WriteSentences) put together
to illustrate the [curriculum
plan](/group/thelastlanguagetextbook/curriculum). Simple click below.

The audio recorder is being finalized as we speak. Expect to see it here
in the next few days. In the meantime, why not try your hand at [writing
example sentences](/group/thelastlanguagetextbook/WriteSentences)?
