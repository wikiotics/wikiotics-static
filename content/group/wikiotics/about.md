## Project Vision

We aim to become a hub for free online language instruction by providing
easy to use tools that help the community create high quality materials.

The initial [project vision](/en/project_vision) should give a feel for
what we are working on and where we are going. We are also trying to
start a list of [similar and complementary projects](/en/Links) that can
be useful during the language-learning process.

If you are interested, the easiest way to help is to use the site and
let us know what you think. Other ways to help are listed on the [Get
Involved](/en/Get_involved) page.

## Wikiotics Foundation

The [Wikiotics Foundation](/en/Wikiotics_Foundation) is a nonprofit
organization dedicated to making an interactive language instruction
system that is freely licensed and freely available to anyone online.
Our major activities include developing custom free software for
collaborative language instruction and running the
<http://wikiotics.org> community site where teachers and students from
all over the world can come together to build high quality language
instruction materials.

Wikiotics has 501(c)(3) status in the United States, allowing us to
accept tax-deductible contributions. If you would like to contribute to
the foundation, please contact: donate@wikiotics.org. If you cannot, or
would prefer not to, make a financial donation, please consider
[contributing](http://alpha.wikiotics.org/en/Contribute) to the project
instead.
