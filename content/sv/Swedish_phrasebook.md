This phrasebook is split in several sections according to topics. It
includes a variety of words and sentences in English and their
translations in Swedish, as well as an audio recording so you can
actually hear how things are pronounced.

Each section is available as a podcast, so you can download the audio
version, copy it to your audio player, print out the text, and rehearse
on your way to Sweden :)
