Wikiotics is a community effort at collaborative language instruction.
If you are interested in learning a language, teaching one to someone
else, or helping to develop innovative tools for either task, just
follow the links below.

## [Learn a language](/en/Take_a_lesson)

[Choose a language](/en/Take_a_lesson) to begin learning now. People
have contributed content for over twenty different languages.

## [Teach a language](/en/Make_a_lesson)

If you want to help someone learn a language (and if you are reading
this, you can help with [English](/en/English_lessons)\!), take a look
at our [Make a lesson](/en/Make_a_lesson) page. In short: for any
existing lesson, click the "edit" button at the bottom. To begin making
