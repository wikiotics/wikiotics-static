Hi\! I'm Ian Sullivan, one of the founders of the Wikiotics project and
the current President of the [Wikiotics
Foundation](/en/Wikiotics_Foundation), the non-profit that hosts this
site and sponsors the development of the [ductus
software](http://ductus.us) that runs the wiki.

I've made some of the initial English language lessons and have moved a
copy here so you'll always be able to see my current version. Please
feel free to copy these lessons to your own user section or anywhere
else you want to work on them.

All of my available lessons are listed on my [lessons
page](/user/ian/lessons)

In preparation for our summer pilot project, we are brainstorming a list
of [basic language points](/en/basic_language_points) and concepts that
we can build lessons to address.
