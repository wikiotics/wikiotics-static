Ordinal Numbers Explanation

Ordinal numbers or 'numbers' are used for stating the quantity of
something as well as counting. When we need to know "**how many**" we
count. Numbers can be written with letters or in number form. It's
important to memorize some numbers like those in your address or your
phone number.
