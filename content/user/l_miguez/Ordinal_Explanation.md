Ordinal numbers differ from Cardinal numbers (or normal numbers used for
counting. i.e.  1, 2, 3…) in that ordinal numbers refer to a position in
a series. They are also used for days the month.

For example: 

**Position**:

  - On Monday, my **first** class is biology, my **second** class is
    gym.
  - She ran fast and won the race. She was **first**.
  - Her best friend doesn't run very fast and she came in **seventh**.

**Dates**:

  - Today is June the **fifth**. **
  - On February **fourteenth**, we celebrate Valentine's Day.

We normally write ordinal numbers in number form and not in letter form
when we talk about days of the month. We would generally write February
fourteenth as **February 14<sup>th</sup>** .

Any ordinal number that doesn't end in st, nd, rd (as in "first",
"second", or "third"), ends in th.All compound numbers from twenty-one
through ninety-nine should be separated by a hyphen (twenty-two,
seventy-first). A comma is optional with four-digit numbers but required
with five-digit numbers (3000   30,000)
