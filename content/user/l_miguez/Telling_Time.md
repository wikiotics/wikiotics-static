**Telling Time in English**

Knowing how to tell time correctly in English is important for everyday
conversation. In English, there are two ways to tell time:

  - Digital – which is also the easiest way to tell time.
  - Classical - where you say the minutes first then the hour.

For 4:25, you could say:

**Four - twenty five** -  like it would appear on a digital clock.

Or

**Twenty five after/past four**

Both forms are correct, however the digital way is more informal.
