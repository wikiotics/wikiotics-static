**Telling Time in English**

Knowing how to tell time correctly in English is important for everyday
conversation. In English, there are two ways to tell time:

  - Digital – which is also the easiest way to tell time.
  - Classical - where you say the minutes first then the hour.

For **4:25**, you could say:

**Four - twenty five** -  like it would appear on a digital clock.

Or

**Twenty five after/past four**

**Rules for telling time using the classical method**

  - We use **o'clock** when it is exactly on the hour. **Example:** It's
    nine **o'clock**. (9:00)
  - We use "past or after" to say times after the hour until 30 minutes
    past the hour. **Example**: It's ten **past** three. (3:10)
  - We use "**to**" for times after 31 minutes until the next exact
    hour. Example: It's twenty **to** six. (6:40)
